Car CRUD Application

How to Use:

List of Car VIN Numbers in the system are displayed upon opening the form.

Double clicking a VIN number will hide the parent form and display the details of that VIN number's car.
The details are able to be edited. At the bottom, there is an "Update" and a "Delete" button.
Clicking update will update the details to the text file, while clicking delete will delete the car from the file.

At the bottom of the parent form, there is an "Add Car" button.
This will open a new form where details for a new car can be entered.
If all the fields are filled, then the new car will be added to the text file.

All CRUD functions are contained in their own class called "TxtFileCRUD" (to clean up the program).
